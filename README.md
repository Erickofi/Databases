Web App with Aurora DB Connection
 Overview:
This project demonstrates a secure web application deployment on AWS that connects to an Aurora database. The architecture includes:
VPC for network isolation
EC2 instance running the web application
Aurora database cluster
Security groups for both EC2 and Aurora
Proper networking configuration for secure communication

Prerequisites:
AWS Account with appropriate permissions
AWS CLI installed and configured
Basic understanding of AWS services (VPC, EC2, Aurora)
Git installed

 Aurora Database Setup

Create Aurora DB cluster in the VPC
Configure Aurora security group to allow inbound traffic from EC2 security group
Note down the endpoint for database connection

 EC2 Instance Setup:
Launch EC2 instance in the same VPC
Configure EC2 security group to allow:
Inbound HTTP (80)
Inbound HTTPS (443)
SSH (22) from your IP

Application Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bashCopygit clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
2. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file:
CopyDB_HOST=<your-aurora-endpoint>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
DB_USER=<your-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>
3. Install Dependencies
bashCopynpm install
4. Database Connection
javascriptCopy// db.js example
const mysql = require('mysql2');
require('dotenv').config();

const pool = mysql.createPool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  waitForConnections: true,
  connectionLimit: 10,
  queueLimit: 0
});

module.exports = pool.promise();
Security Considerations

Store sensitive information in AWS Secrets Manager
Use IAM roles for EC2 to access Aurora
Regularly update security group rules
Implement SSL/TLS for database connections
Follow AWS security best practices

Deployment
1. Database Migration
bashCopy# Run database migrations
npm run migrate
2. Application Deployment
bashCopy# Start the application
npm start
Monitoring

Set up CloudWatch monitoring for both EC2 and Aurora
Configure alarms for critical metrics
Monitor database connections and performance
